How to run our Program:

First in this order you do these commands all in different terminals

- "go run backupNode.go 0"
- "go run backupNode.go 1"
- "go run primaryNode.go 0 10"
- "go run bidder.go 1"
- "go run bidder.go 2"

After you've done this you can now bid in the bidder.go terminals by writing bid and a chosen number, or checking the status of the auction by writing result

Enjoy <3
